# xpl-web-panels
This is javascript wrapper around [X-plane 12 Web API](https://developer.x-plane.com/article/x-plane-web-api/) which makes it super simple to use at web pages.

# Background
At some moment flight simmers try to have all controls available at single click/touch as in the real plane. Without changing view and looking for the knob at virtual cockpit. Of course the best option is to have hardware panels, but they are costly or difficult to build.

So this is often simulated by (touch)screen showing the panel and having click spots to control the knobs. There are many products available to achieve this - some paid, some free.

But with some little coding it's not difficult to create such panels from the scratch and have full control. Whether you create panel with the most realistic look as in the real plane or some "synthetic version" just for flight simulation making your more effective (e.g. switching views).
